# Environment Variables

This document describes the environment variables used by `<app>`.

Please note that **undefined** variables and **empty strings** are considered
equivalent.

The application may consume other undocumented environment variables; this
document only shows those variables defined using [Austenite].

```sh
export LOG_LEVEL=debug # show information for developers
export LOG_LEVEL=info  # standard log messages

export LOG_LEVEL=error # a healthy application shouldn't produce any errors
export LOG_LEVEL=fatal # the application cannot proceed
```
